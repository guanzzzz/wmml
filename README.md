# wmml
A quick interface toolkit for machine learning

## Installation (With Anaconda)
WMML requires Python version 3.X, and using Anaconda is recommended. Please download Anaconda from [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and install first.

Once you installed Anaconda (with Python 3.X), clone the repository by doing:

```
git clone https://github.com/guanzzzz/wmml.git
```

Then go to the wmml directory and create a new Python environment for wmml by run:

```
conda env create -f requirements.yaml --name wmml
```

Please refer to the requirements.yaml for dependencies.

To activate an environment in your Command Terminal Window, run:

```
conda activate wmml
```

You will see the active environment in parentheses at the beginning of your Command Prompt:

```
(wmml) #
```

Now wmml is ready to use! To open the wmml main interface, run:

```
python wmml.py
```
